<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Sundubu jjigae is a Korean stew made with soft (uncurdled) tofu as a highlight ingredient.<br>
There are a few different ways to make sundubu jjigae using different ingredients (e.g. kimchi, minced pork and seafood) but by far my favorite version is the seafood version known as Haemul Sundubu Jjigae (해물 순두부 찌개).  You can really taste the refreshing and clear tasting soup.</p>
